## Introduction

LangGraph-learn is designed to foster a collaborative learning environment for individuals interested in AI and machine learning. Our goal is to provide practical examples and tutorials that demonstrate how to use LangGraph, LangChain, and other related tools to build efficient and reusable workflows involving language models.

## Getting Started

To get started with LangGraph-learn, you will need to set up your environment. Here are some general steps:

1. **Install Python 3.11**: Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed on your machine.
2. **Install Required Packages**: Depending on the examples you are working with, you may need the following Python packages:
   - `langgraph`
   - `langchain-community`
   - `langchain-core`
   - `httpx`
   - `tenacity<8.4.0`

   You can install these packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-core ollama chromadb langgraph
   ```
   Please bear in mind, this is generic and will be updated in all sub folders as needed.

3. **Set Up Local Language Models**: Some examples may require local language models such as ChatOllama. Follow the instructions in the relevant example directories to set up these models.
